## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handled **missing values** and removed **duplicate entries**.  
- Converted **Installs** and **Price** columns into numeric format.  
- Standardized **Category** and **Genres** text data for consistency.  
- Converted **Last Updated** to datetime format for time-based insights.  
- Ensured correct data types across all columns for accurate analysis.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Performed  
- Calculated **average app rating**, total number of apps, and unique categories.  
- Visualized **distribution of app sizes**, ratings, and installs.  
- Compared **Free vs Paid apps** and their **average number of reviews**.  
- Identified **Top 5 most installed apps** and **Top-rated categories**.  
- Found **average app size by category** and most common **content rating**.  
- Analyzed **correlation between installs and ratings**.  
- Explored **impact of app size and price** on installs and ratings.  
- Investigated **update frequency** and apps last updated in 2018.  
- Found **Top 5 categories with maximum total installs**.

## 📈 Insights & Findings  
- Majority of apps are **free**, but **paid apps** often have **higher ratings**.  
- **Games**, **Tools**, and **Entertainment** are top categories with the most installs.  
- Apps with **ratings above 4.0** tend to have **more reviews and installs**.  
- **Smaller apps** are downloaded more frequently due to performance and storage convenience.  
- Most apps are rated for **“Everyone”**, showing a broad user base.  
- **Regular updates** are linked with higher user satisfaction and engagement.
